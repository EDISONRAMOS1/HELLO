<p style="font-family:arial; font-size:16"><b><u>But first, WHAT IS A LINEAR FUNCTION?</b></u><br>
A linear function is defined by <b>f(x) = mx + b</b>, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept, m and b are not both equal to zero. The <b>degree of the function is one</b> and its <b>graph is a line.</b><br><br>

A linear function is a function that represents a <b>straight line on the coordinate plane</b>. For example, y = 3x - 2 represents a straight line on a coordinate plane and hence it represents a linear function. Since y can be replaced with f(x), this function can be written as f(x) = 3x - 2.<br><br>

A linear function is of the <b>form f(x) = mx + b where 'm' and 'b' are real numbers</b>. Isn't it looking like the slope-intercept form of a line which is expressed as y = mx + b? 

Yes, this is because a linear function represents a line, i.e., its graph is a line.<b>'m' is the slope of the line,'b' is the y-intercept of the line, 'x' is the independent variable, and 'y' (or f(x)) is the dependent variable.</b><br>

<br><b>ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES</b><br>
<u>Is the function f defined by f(x) = 2x + 3 a linear function?</u><br>
Yes, the function f defined by f(x) = 2x + 3 is a linear function since the highest exponent (degree) of x is one and it is written in the form f(x) = mx + b. The slope m is 2 while the y-intercept b is 3.<br><br>

<u>Is the function g defined by g(x) = -x a linear function?</u><br>
Yes, the function g is a linear function because the degree is one. Since g(x) = -x can be written as g(x) = -x + 0, its slope is -1 and y-intercept is 0.<br><br>

<u>Is the function h defined by h(x) = x2 + 5x + 4 a linear function?</u><br>
The function h is not a linear function because its degree (the highest exponent of x) is 2, not 1.<br><br>

<u>A Linear function can be described using its graph.</u><br>
