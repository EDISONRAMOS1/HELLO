<p style="font-family:arial; font-size:16"> A <b>variable</b> in Mathematics is defined as the <i>alphabetic character that expresses a numerical value or a number.</i><br> In algebraic equations, a variable is used to represent an unknown quantity.<br>These variables can be any alphabets from a to z. Most commonly, ‘a’,’b’,’c’, ‘x’,’y’ and ‘z’ are used as variables in equations. <br>

<b>There are two types of variables that we will be tackling; the Dependent and Independent Variables.</b>
</br><br>

<u>INDEPENDENT VARIABLES</u><br>
In an algebraic equation, an independent variable describes a variable whose values are independent of changes and does not rely on the other variable. <br>If x and y are two variables in an algebraic equation and every value of x is linked with any other value of y, <br>then ‘y’ value is said to be a function of x value known as an independent variable, and ‘y’ value is known as a dependent variable. <br><br>

<u>DEPENDENT VARIABLES</u><br>
 The dependent variable is characterized as the variable whose quality depends on the estimation of another variable in its condition. <br>That is, the estimation of the word variable is dependably said to be reliant on the free variable of math condition. <br>The variable ‘y’ is said to be a reliant variable as it depends on the other variable to get its value. 
<br>

<p style="font-family:arial; font-size:16"> A salesman's monthly salary is determined by how many products he can sell for the whole month.<br>

In this sentence, the independent variable is: <b> <i> how many products he was able to sell for the whole month. </i> </b> <br>Meanwhile, the dependent variable is: <b> <i> a salesman's monthly salary. </i> </b> <br>

Another example is: The amount of toppings you put on your frozen yogurt at your favorite froyo shop decides the price of the frozen treat.<br>

 For this sentence, the independent variable is: <b> <i> the price of the frozen treat. </i> </b><br>
Meanwhile, the dependent variable is: <b> <i> the amount of toppings you put on your frozen yogurt at your favorite froyo shop. </i> </b>
<br>

Keep in mind that the independent variable is the variable that <b> <i> decides the outcome of the dependent variable! </i> </b><br><br>
